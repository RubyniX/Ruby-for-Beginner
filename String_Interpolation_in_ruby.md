## Defining String
As most of the readers are aware of, string is the collection of characters. String in ruby can be represented in either single quotes i.e.

`my_string = 'Ruby on Rails'`

or in double quotes i.e.

`my_string = “Ruby on Rails”`

The basic difference between single and double quotes is single quotes cannot print escape characters while double quotes can print escape characters. Let us take a look with an example:

```ruby
my_string = 'Ruby on Rails \nDeveloper'
puts my_string
#Output: Ruby on Rails \nDeveloper
```

The above code snippet is for single quotes. Now let us look at double quotes case:

```ruby
my_string = “Ruby on Rails \nDeveloper”
puts my_string
#Output:
#Ruby on Rails
#Developer
```

Here, we see that the literal `\n` is not printed, but an actual newline is printed instead.


### String Interpolation

When it comes to the discussion of escape character we cannot forget the topic of String Interpolation. Double quotes are interpolated, meaning the code in `#{}` is evaluated as Ruby code and single quotes are treated as literal i.e. the code is not being evaluated as Ruby code. For Example:

```ruby
my_string = "Ruby on Rails"
puts "I am a #{my_string} Developer"
#Output: I am a Ruby on Rails Developer
``` 

and the code snippet with single quotes is shown below:

```ruby
my_string = “Ruby on Rails”
puts ‘I am a #{my_string} Developer’
#Output: I am a #{my_string} Developer.
```
