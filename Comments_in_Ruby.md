In programming languages **comments** are lines of code that are ignored at runtime by the compiler or interpreter.

In **Ruby** both _single-line_ and _multi-line_ comments exist.

### Singleline Comments in Ruby

A single line comment in Ruby starts with `#` character.

**Example**

```ruby
# This is a single-line comment.
puts "Hello World"
```

The output generated by the program will be `Hello World`.

### Multiline Comments in Ruby

You can comment multiple lines using **=begin** and **=end** syntax.

**Example**

```ruby
=begin
This is a multiline 
comment But =begin and =end should come in the first line only. 
=end
puts "Hello World"
```

The output generated by the program will be `Hello World`.

### Why to use comments in programs?

- To add a description to the program.
- To avoid confusion while collaboration.
- To improve understanding of the program.
- To avoid future errors.
